## What's a Design Pattern?

Let's start from the beginning, first we have to understand what's a Design Pattern. A simple way to describe it is "A known solution for a known problem" different from an algorithm that's actually a step-by-step guide to solve a problem the Design Pattern is more like an idea of how you can solve a common problem that you can implement the way you want.
